TODO: 

- ~~Add frontend form page ASAP so clients can start adding their own photos.~~
- Write function to keep pinging the backend so it doesn't fall asleep (Check if this will push usage  over the free plan's limit first)
- ~~Ask client if they're willing to pay $7 month for 24/7 uptime hosting~~
- Add edit, update, delete functionality
- Make the form mobile responsive
- Get a deal on heroku service and re-deploy the api on heroku instead of render
- add page to display current state of database to user
- add validation on the form fields
